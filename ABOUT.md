# Named Editor Groups

A mod commissioned by [Rue](https://x.com/xRueOfficial).

A mod that allows you to abstract away <ca>IDs</c> by giving them a <cg>name</c>.

Currently supports:

- Group IDs
- Collision IDs
- Counter IDs
- Timer IDs
- Effect IDs
- Color IDs

The ID's name is previewed in the editor, and you can directly search and create new Named IDs from any trigger's popup.
The IDs are stored in the level, so anyone with the mod and a copy of the level can see its Named IDs!

- The ID's name <cr>cannot</c> exceed <cy>24 characters</c> <cg>(it's recommended to keep them shorter than 14 characters)</c>
- It is recommended that the ID's name shouldn't <cy>only contain numbers</c> or <cy>only symbols</c>
- Each ID <cr>must</c> have its own <cy>unique name</c>.
- Valid Named IDs characters are: <cg>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz@_-,.!$^&*()+=/<>?\01234567890</c>
- You can Export/Import Named IDs
- You can make IDs previewable or not, and give them descriptions by clicking the settings button besides in the Edit Named IDs popup (<cy>requires</c> <cg>[Level ID API by Cvolton](mod:cvolton.level-id-api)</c>, <cr>this data is not saved in the level and not exported</c>)

You can also view and add Named IDs from the Level Settings popup (settings button besides the pause button in the editor) by clicking on the options button on the bottom right.
