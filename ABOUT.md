# Named Editor Groups

A mod commissioned by [Rue](https://x.com/xRueOfficial).

A mod that allows you to abstract away <ca>IDs</c> by giving them a <cg>name</c>.

Currently supports:

- Group IDs
- Collision IDs
- Counter IDs

The ID's name is previewed in the editor, and you can directly search and create new Named IDs from any trigger's popup.

Some constraints about the ID:

- The ID's name <cr>cannot</c> exceed <cy>20 characters</c> <cg>(it's recommended to keep them shorter than 14 characters)</c>
- The ID's name <cr>cannot</c> contain <cy>only numbers</c> or <cy>only symbols</c>
- Each ID <cr>must</c> have its own <cy>unique name</c>.
- Valid Named IDs characters are: <cg>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-,.01234567890</c>

You can also view and add Named IDs from the Level Settings screen by clicking on the options button on the bottom right.
